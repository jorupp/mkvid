## How does this work

Basically, you take a file that FFMPEG can read (ie. a `mp4`), extract images from it, then run those images through `build-file.py` to generate a text file that is useful for something.

## What is `key` in `build-file.py`?

If you have to ask, I can't tell you.

## What is this text file used for?

Sorry, I can't help you with that either.
